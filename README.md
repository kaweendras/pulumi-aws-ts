# Pulumi Learning Project

## Overview

This repository contains my learning exercises and experiments with [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/), an infrastructure as code tool that lets you create, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure using familiar programming languages.

## ⚠️ DISCLAIMER

**This project is NOT intended for production use.**

This repository is solely created for:

- Learning Pulumi concepts and workflows
- Experimenting with different infrastructure configurations
- Understanding infrastructure as code principles
- Personal skill development

## What is Pulumi?

Pulumi is an open-source infrastructure as code tool that allows you to define cloud resources using general-purpose programming languages like:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Python
- Go
- .NET (C#, F#)

Instead of using domain-specific languages like HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language), Pulumi leverages the full power of programming languages to create, deploy, and manage cloud infrastructure.

## Learning Resources

- [Pulumi Documentation](https://www.pulumi.com/docs/)
